# Project Setup

## Getting Started

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will now be running — you're project should now be opening in another tab (make sure to not block popups).
