## Context
You have a simple e-commerce app that:
- Fetches products from ProductService.cs
- Displays the products in a list

## Task
Your task is to implement a filter panel for the product list.
An API endpoint is available in ProductController.cs at:POST /api/products/filter
Timebox: 1–2 hours

## Deliverable
- Fork the repository and commit your solution.
- Invite gismya and corneliahaypp to your fork. (Settings > Collaborators)

## Requirements
- Ability to filter products with lime flavour only.
- Ability to filter products that are beverages only.

## Technical interview
During the technical interview, we’ll review your changes together and discuss:
Your approach and implementation of the filter functionality
Ideas for improving and extending the existing codebase
Be prepared to explain your design decisions and share how you would enhance the overall structure, performance, or maintainability of the application.

## Getting Started
